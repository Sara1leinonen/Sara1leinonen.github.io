	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hi! My name is Sara Leinonen, I am a sophomore at South Carolina as a Biology major in hopes of going to medical school someday. I was born in Spencer, Iowa but raised in Anderson, SC just 15 minutes away from Clemson University. During my time at Pendleton High School, I was on the volleyball team for 2 years, basketball and soccer teams for 4 years, and was in Beta Club with National Honors Society. Growing up, I was a huge Clemson fan but I'm so happy that I committed to USC because it's medical program is the best in the state, our sports team are fun to watch, and I love the community on campus.</p>
	<p id="me" class="hidden">I am so happy I chose to go to South Carolina because I love going to football games in Willy B. with my friends on a Saturday waving our sandstorm towels in the student section. Also, our girls' basketball team is one of the top teams in the country with winning a National Championship last year and having five WNBA draft picks this year. This year, I joined Epsilon Sigma Alpha (ESA), a service sorority on campus, everyone is so nice and I can't wait to be besties with my big, Maddy!!</p>

	<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
	<p>The main reason why I chose to come to South Carolina is to pursue a career in the medical field. So far, I have learned that I like psychology and anatomy but I don't like learning about plants, so anything with ecology and environmental science is not a path for me. However, I love sports, science, and I like learning about the immune system, so I might want to either work in a children's hospital or become an orthopedic. After my time at USC, I would love to move either up North or the Midwest for medical school and travel the world. I would love to go to the University of Michigan or University of Pennsylvania for Medical School but those schools are tough to get into to.</p>
	<p id="future" class="hidden">If I become an orthopedic someday, I would love to work for a college sports' team but also have a doctor-like office for a big medical community. For example, Dr. Jeffrey Guy is the orthopedic for our women's basketball team but he also treats normal patients at Prisma Health in Lexington, SC. I hope I have a similar job like his because it is a combination of my favorite things, sports and science. However, orthopedics have to go to school for a long time and they play a critical role in performing surgeries on children in the community.</p>
